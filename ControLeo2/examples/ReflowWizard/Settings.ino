// The ATMEGA32U4 has 1024 bytes of EEPROM.  We use some of it to store settings so that
// the oven doesn't need to be reconfigured every time it is turned on.  Uninitialzed 
// EEPROM is set to 0xFF (255).  One of the first things done when powering up is to
// see if the EEPROM is uninitialized - and initialize it if that is the case.
//
// All settings are stored as bytes (unsigned 8-bit values).  This presents a problem
// for the maximum temperature which can be as high as 280C - which doesn't fit in a
// 8-bit variable.  With the goal of making getSetting/setSetting as simple as possible,
// we could've saved all values as 16-bit values, using consecutive EEPROM locations. We
// instead chose to just offset the temperature by 150C, making the range 25 to 130 instead
// of 175 to 280.
