This is the GitHub source code repository for ControLeo2.  ControLeo2 is an Arduino Leonardo
controller with quad relay outputs used to control reflow ovens.

In this folder are:
1. README - this file
2. A "ControLeo2” folder.  This is an Arduino library and examples for ControLeo2

To install the ControLeo2 library, please refer to:

Reflow Wizard
=============
* 1.0  Initial public release. (21 October 2014)
* 1.1  Bug fixes (30 December 2014)
*      - Oven temperature might not reach configured maximum temperature
*      - Adjusted values so learning happens faster
*      - Other minor improvements
* 1.2  Improvements (6 January 2014)
*      - Take temperature readings every 0.125s and average them.  Fixes errors
*        generated by noise from convection fans
*      - Refined learning mode so learning should happen in fewer runs
*      - Improved loop duration timer to enhance timing
*      - Moved some strings from RAM to Flash (there is only 2.5Kb of RAM)
* 1.3  No user-facing changes (19 January 2013)
*      - Fixed compiler warnings for Arduino 1.5.8
* 1.4  Added support for servos (6 February 2015)
*      - When using a servo, please connect a large capacitor (e.g. 220uF, 16V)
*        between +5V and GND to avoid a microcontroller reset when the servo
*        stall current causes the voltage to drop.  Small servos may not need
*        a capacitor
*      - Connect the servo to +5V, GND and D3
*      - The open and close positions are configured in the Settings menu
*      - The oven door will open when the reflow is done, and close at 50C.
*        The door is also closed when ControLeo2 is turned on.
*
* Oven door servo:
* ================
* Version 1.4 adds support for a servo to open the oven door when the reflow is done.  The
* door should be opened 1” - 2” so the temperature drop does not exceed 6°C/second.
* Small servos (like the TG9) are probably powerful enough to open the oven door. Large
* servos (like the MG945 with metal gears) will work too - with a caveat.  Large servos mean
* large stall currents which can cause the voltage to the microcontroller to drop and cause
* a brown-out reset.  Regardless of the servo used, it is recommended that you place a 
* large capacitor (e.g. 220uF, 16V) between +5V and GND.
*
* The power supply used to power ControLeo2 should provide at least 1000mA, but preferably
* 1.5A to even 2A.  The power supplies provided in the ControLeo2 oven build kit are 2A.
